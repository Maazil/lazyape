        This project is called LazyApe and it's a product/ service for students in Norway. 
        The product offers an auto-generated schedule for the user. 
        We are five computer engineer students from UiA in Grimstad, 
        and we got this idea to make this from another course. 
        The project required skills and knowledge from .NET, C#, Javascript and CSS. 
        The tools that have been used are GIT, bitbucket, JIRA, Rider, Feide and Fullcalendar.
        We used Feide to integrate and get user data in order to get their courses and classes. 
        Fullcalendar was used in order for us to use a functional calendar for our functionalities needed.
        We hope that this service help students with the planing. 
        Since we are students ourselves, we know how difficult planing can be. 
        Before we got this idea we made a short survey where we asked students how they planned their week.
        We found out that many of them didn't make a plan, the reasoning was that they didn't like the apps that are available.

        <h1>Auto Generation</h1>
        <div class="Text" > 
            <p>

                The difference between our service and all the other services with scheduler is that ours are auto-generated.
                That means the user will put in grades they want in different courses and our algorithm
                will take this into account and generate based on the users wish.

                If they desire a higher grade it will generate more study hours and vice versa.

                This is as mentioned a student project, you might therefor expect some bugs and lack of some functionalities.<br/>
